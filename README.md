# Sales Forecast Documentation

## Outline

Sales forecasting using Machine Learning involves analyzing various data sources to predict future sales. The following outlines key components to consider in the sales forecasting process:

## Input Data

### 1. Historical Sales Data
   - Break down sales data by product categories, specific products, or regions for granular patterns.
   
### 2. Promotional Data
   - Include information about promotions, discounts, and marketing campaigns.
   - Consider the timing and effectiveness of promotions, as they impact sales.

### 3. Economic Indicators
   - Incorporate economic indicators such as inflation rates, unemployment rates, and GDP growth.
   - Economic conditions influence consumer spending habits.

### 4. Competitor Data
   - Analyze competitor activities, pricing strategies, and market share.
   - Changes in the competitive landscape can affect sales.

### 5. Social Media and Sentiment Analysis
   - Monitor social media platforms for brand, product, or industry mentions.
   - Use sentiment analysis to gain insights into customer perceptions and trends.

### 6. Customer Demographics
   - Include age, gender, location, and other relevant information.
   - Different demographic groups may have distinct purchasing behaviors.

### 7. Seasonal Trends
